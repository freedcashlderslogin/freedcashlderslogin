Payday loans have been around for a while, and are still a popular option amongst millions of people who need to access emergency cash. If you spend time watching television, or browsing the internet, you will no doubt see many adverts from Payday loan companies, encouraging you to borrow from them. So, regardless of which company you choose to do business with, and whatever the press and media continue to say, there is little doubt that Payday loans are a significant and real financial credit option for many households today.

According to recently published figures, more than 2 million working families turn to a short term payday loan when they are short of cash, or having a financial emergency.

Most people are aware that Payday loans are not the best option if they have long term debt problems, or are struggling with extremely low income. In these extreme financial situations, Payday loans are not recommended. Certainly, good lenders will always advise borrowers to think carefully about their own financial situation, and to consider whether a short term loan is best for them.
